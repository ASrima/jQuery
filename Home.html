	<h1> Keep Inspiring Me</h1>

	<P><strong>
		You have complete control over only one thing in the universe — your thinking – and that’s where motivational quotes come in! You can decide what you are going to think in any given situation. <br>Your thoughts and feelings determine your actions and determine the results you get. It all starts with your thoughts – and I have found that inspirational words are a quick way to retune your thinking. Try keeping a few uplifting excerpts or positive proclamations on hand.<br> If you ever notice your energy or your spirit begin to drop, simply recite an inspirational and uplifting quote to quickly boost your mood.</strong>
